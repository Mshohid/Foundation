# Album Maker.py 

A little program that builds a dictionary describing a music album.

# Dicey2.py

A dice game between two players.
If you roll an even number 10 points will be added bonus and if you roll an odd number 5 points will be subtracted.
A dice game consists of 3 rounds. Each round each player rolls a six-sided dice, and the program determines who has won by comparing the two scores.
As consecutive rounds commence scores from previous rounds are added and the program compares the total scores and prints out who is in the lead and who is behind.
At the end of the game,the program will create a .txt file called "Dicey2 Scores" and save the scores of both players, if the file already exists it will append to the contents of it.

# Fizzbuzz.py

As part of the AWS re/Start course my instructor challenged me to make a programme re-enact the game fizzbuzz but using python.

# Lockdown_dreaming.py

This year (2020) many people had their plans ruined by Covid-19, including mine. A ruined holiday to Turkey combined with dictionaries, flags, loops, and inputs made the perfect inspiration for a python program. 

# Optimus-Prime.py

A program that can accurately return which numbers are prime within a range. 

# Scrape.py 

My instructor wanted to see what I could do using beautiful soup so I built this in reponse. This is a scraper which I designed to pull the AWS blogs page and only print out the categories of content on the site.

# Snakey.py

I enjoy playing games so I wanted to see if I could possibly write one. In my spare time I followed a tutorial on the internet and made this snake game using pygame on python. 
The tutorial has a lot more instructions, but I only used what I understood from it to design my snake game.

# Spooky.py

As part of the AWS re/Start programme I had studied Python. After a lesson covering if statements, lists, and loops, my instructor gave me 30 minutes to design a programme using those concepts. I came up with this story/whats-behind-the-door type game

# Users.py
Recently I was challenged to make a program which emulates the process of creating and storing usernames in an app. Furthermore, the case the names are in should be insensitive and if the username was taken it should explain that another username should be created. 

# Banarama.py 

A programe which uses if statements, import random, and operators to randomly generate a bunch of bananas and determines whether the bunch is small or large.
